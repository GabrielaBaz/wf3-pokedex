# Pokédex!

I was grateful I had been able to reach my 38th year without knowing what a Pokédex was, but that changed today. TBH I was a Mario fan growing up and never got into the Pokemon thing.

So, this is my attempt at a Pokédex mobile app using **Ionic**, **Angular** and a couple of APIs (PokeApi for the info and Pokeres for the images).

This is a project made as part of the Ionic/Cordova course of the Webforce3 Certification.
